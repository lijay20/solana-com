## Solana CLI Basics

<Steps>
<Step>

### Solana Config

To see your current config:

```terminal
$ solana config get
```

You should see output like the following:

```
Config File: /Users/test/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: /Users/test/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

The RPC URL and Websocket URL specify the Solana cluster the CLI makes requests
to.

You can update the Solana CLI cluster using the following commands:

```terminal
$ solana config set --url mainnet-beta
$ solana config set --url devnet
$ solana config set --url localhost
$ solana config set --url testnet
```

You can also use the following short options:

```terminal
$ solana config set -um    # For mainnet-beta
$ solana config set -ud    # For devnet
$ solana config set -ul    # For localhost
$ solana config set -ut    # For testnet
```

The Keypair Path points to the default Solana wallet (keypair) used by the
Solana CLI to pay transaction fees and deploy programs. By default, this file is
stored at `~/.config/solana/id.json`.

</Step>
<Step>

### Create Wallet

To send transactions using the Solana CLI, you need a Solana wallet funded with
SOL.

To generate a keypair at the default Keypair Path, run the following command:

```terminal
$ solana-keygen new
```

You should see output like the following:

```
Generating a new keypair

For added security, enter a BIP39 passphrase

NOTE! This passphrase improves security of the recovery seed phrase NOT the
keypair file itself, which is stored as insecure plain text

BIP39 Passphrase (empty for none):

Wrote new keypair to /Users/test/.config/solana/id.json
===========================================================================
pubkey: 8dBTPrjnkXyuQK3KDt9wrZBfizEZijmmUQXVHpFbVwGT
===========================================================================
Save this seed phrase and your BIP39 passphrase to recover your new keypair:
cream bleak tortoise ocean nasty game gift forget fancy salon mimic amazing
===========================================================================
```

<Callout type="info">

If you already have a file system wallet saved at the default location, this
command doesn't override it unless you explicitly force override using the
`--force` flag.

</Callout>

To view your wallet's address (public key), run:

```terminal
$ solana address
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Airdrop SOL

Request an airdrop of SOL to your wallet to pay for transactions and program
deployments.

Set your cluster to the devnet:

```terminal
$ solana config set -ud
```

Then request an airdrop of devnet SOL:

```terminal
$ solana airdrop 2
```

<Callout>

Devnet airdrops limit requests to 5 SOL per request. If you hit rate limits or
encounter errors, try using the [Web Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com) instead.

</Callout>

To check your wallet's SOL balance, run the following command:

```terminal
$ solana balance
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Run Local Validator

The Solana CLI includes a built-in
[test validator](https://docs.anza.xyz/cli/examples/test-validator) for local
development.

In a separate terminal, run the following command to start a local validator:

```terminal
$ solana-test-validator
```

<Callout>

Remember to also update your CLI to use localhost before running Solana CLI
commands:

```terminal
$ solana config set -ul
```

</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Anchor CLI Basics

This section walks through some common Anchor CLI commands to get you started.
For more information on the Anchor CLI, see the
[Anchor documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs).

<Steps>
<Step>

### Initialize Project

To create a new Anchor project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor init <project-name>
```

For example, to create a project called `my-project`, run:

```terminal
$ anchor init my-project
```

This command creates a new directory with the project name and initializes a new
Anchor project with a basic Rust program and TypeScript test template.

Navigate to the project directory:

```terminal
$ cd <project-name>
```

See the Anchor project's
[file structure](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/quickstart/local#project-file-structure).

</Step>

<Step>
### Build Program

To build your project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor build
```

You can find the compiled program in the `/target/deploy` directory.

</Step>
<Step>

### Deploy Program

To deploy your project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor deploy
```

This command deploys your program to the `cluster` specified in the
[`Anchor.toml`](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/references/anchor-toml) file.

</Step>
<Step>

### Test Program

To test your project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor test
```

<Callout>

This command builds, deploys, and runs the tests for your project.

When using `localnet` as the `cluster` in `Anchor.toml`, Anchor automatically
starts a local validator, deploys your program, runs tests, and then stops the
validator.

</Callout>
